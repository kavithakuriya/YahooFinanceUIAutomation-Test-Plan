# Selenium Tests for Yahoo Finance

This project contains automated Selenium WebDriver tests for validating Yahoo Finance functionalities. The tests are written in Java using the TestNG framework and are configured to be run via Maven.

## What I Did
1. **Developed Page Object Model (POM):** 
   - Created reusable and maintainable page classes for Yahoo Finance, including `HomePage` and `StockDetailsPage`.
2. **Implemented Test Cases:** 
   - Designed tests to search for stock symbols, validate auto-suggest options, and verify stock details.
3. **Setup Maven and Dependencies:** 
   - Configured the `pom.xml` file with necessary dependencies like Selenium, TestNG, and WebDriver Manager.
4. **Integrated Waits:**
   - Used custom utility classes for explicit waits.
5. **Configured Test Execution and Reports:**
   - Enabled Maven to execute tests and generate reports.
